# Dibware.F.In.Manufacturing

This is a playground repository to help consolidate F Sharp learning and practices.
The main focus is on applying F# to manufacturing domain problems, exploring functional programming concepts, and building practical solutions.

# BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)

The BHAG for this repository is to create a comprehensive suite of F# types and functions that can be assembled to make logic for
a simple maufacturing and trading game. Initialy the game will be text based and run in the console, but the long term goal is to have a web based front end.
the game will start off simple with a 2D grid for the game area and will grow in complexity over time when the 2D grid becomes a 3d space where lower levels
can be mined.

The initial game will start off single player but the long term goal is to have multiplayer support so player can trade with each other.

# Synopsis of the game

The game is set in a fictional world where players take on the role of industrialists aiming to build and expand their manufacturing empires.
Players will start with a modest amount of capital and a small plot of land rich in natural resources. 
The objective is to efficiently extract, process, and refine these resources to produce valuable goods that can be sold on the market.
As players progress, they can invest in advanced technologies, expand their operations, and navigate market fluctuations to maximize profits.
So whether it's mining raw materials, refining them into usable products, or trading goods on the market, 
players will need to strategize and adapt to succeed in this dynamic industrial landscape.

## Subject Areas

The game will aim to cover various aspects of the mining and refining, and the manufacturing industry, 
including resource management, production planning, logistics, and market dynamics.

These include but are not limited to:
- Mining
- Extraction
- Processing
- Smelting
- Refining
- Inventory management
- Trading

# How can you get involved?

Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, and contribute improvements or new features. 
Whether you're an F# professional or enthusiast or a manufacturing domain expert, your insights and contributions are most welcome!

At the time of writing, this repository is a work in progress and I have only been writing F# for a week and been learning for two weeks.
So all constructive feedback is welcome! I do not know what I am doing yet! I have come from an Obect Orientated C# background.
I do have experience with some functional programming approaches in C#, like `Result<T>`, `Maybe<T>` but I am very new to F#.
